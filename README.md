# DATA610_hw1-
## Overview  
For this project I selected the 2019 World Happiness Report from Kaggle. This is a fairly large datatset so I only imported the first 25 rankings by country, in order to take a look at what makes these top the Happiness study. Therefore, the calculations for outliers, the mean, and the bar graphs only include these countries. 
## Goal
My goal was to demonstrate how the determining factors affect the overall scores by visually displaying the categories using bar graphs.
