# DATA610_hw1-
## Overview  
For this project I selected the 2019 World Happiness Report from Kaggle. This is a fairly large datatset so I only imported the first 25 rankings by country, in order to take a look at what makes these top the Happiness study. Therefore, the calculations for outliers, the mean, and the bar graphs only include these countries.

## Goal
My goal was to demonstrate how the determining factors affect the overall scores by visually displaying the categories using bar graphs. 

## Overall Happiness

## Findings
Overall, in the top 25 countries there were very few categories that had outliers. Healthy Life Expectancy, Social Support, and GDP per Capita were the only evaluations that contained outliers. Finland, which ranked the highest for overall happiness had consistently high scores, except for in Generosity. The scores for GDP per Capita, Healthy Life Expectancy, and Freeedom to Make Life Choices were all fairly consistent, while the categories of Perceptions of Corruption and Generosity varied widely. 

## Conclusion
In order to be in the top 25 countries for the happiness score Healthy Life Expectancy, Social Support, and GDP per Capita are all important categories to get a high score in. While the categories of Perceptions of Corruption and Generosity can be scored poorly in well still kepping the Overall Happiness Score high.
